 "var" is a container that stores certains statement.

var x = 5 //"x" is an identifier.
var y = 6 //"=" is an assignment operator, NOT an "equal to".
var z = x + y // it calculates he value of x and y and puts the result into "z". The value of z is the sum of x and y.

console.log(x) // expected outcome is 5 because x (stores the value of) = 5
console.log(y) // expected outcome is 6 because x = 6
console.log(z) // expected outcome is 11 because z = x + y or 11 = 5 + 6

// Example:

var price1 = 5.99 
var price2 = 6.99
var total = price1 + price2

console.log({total})

// Sometimes, you end up finishing writing a statement with a semicolon (;).I advises to use it as a recommended option but it's debatable.
