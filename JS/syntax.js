// This is used with the console.log. Open nodemon and work wih the terminal.

/*The base syntax of js is:

(1) to declare variables;
(2) to assign values;
(3) and to computes values.

// Example:

let x, y, z // (1)
x = 5; y = 6 // (2)
z = x + y // (3)

result = z // The outcome is 11 because 5 + 6 is x + y = z.

// Values

// There are two type of values: literals and variables.

var result = "Hello!" // var (let above) is a variable and result is a literal. Those two form a begining of a statement.
var result = "How old are you?" // Strings are written with double (or single) quotes.
var result = "23" // Numbers are written with or without decimals.

// There many kinds of statements that you can type: variables, operators, expressions, keywords, comments...

console.log(result)
