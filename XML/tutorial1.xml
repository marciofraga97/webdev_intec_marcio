XML is often used for distributing data over the Internet, while HTML is used to display data.
Those two are completely diferent languages.

HTML uses already predefined tags such as <div>, <body> or <p>.
While XML doesn't need to use predefined tags, because you create these yourself to store data.

-> Important XML Standards

- XML AJAX
- XML DOM
- XML XPath
- XML XSLT
- XML XQuery
- XML DTD
- XML Schema
- XML Services

-> Example:

XML's syntax is constructed as a tree with children and subchildren:

-->

<note>
<to>Marcio</to>
<from>Fraga</from>
<heading>Reminder</heading>
<body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
